# Benchmarks

- bench-python: Python benchmarks comparing performance with h5py.
- bench-java: Re-implementation of [n5-java benchmarks](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/master/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/N5Benchmark.java)

There is also a [repository with an asv benchmark suite](https://github.com/constantinpape/z5py-benchmarks) to keep track of the z5 performance.
The results are hosted [here](https://constantinpape.github.io/z5py-benchmarks/)
